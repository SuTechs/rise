# Rise - Habit Tracker App Flutter

![Cover Image](preview.png)

## Overview

Rise is a habit tracker app inspired by a hidden gem category app on the Play Store, which was awarded the App of the Year 2024. I found this app simple and easy to develop in Flutter, and it can be done in one day. Therefore, I decided to recreate this app using Flutter to showcase the power of Flutter and how easy it is to develop apps using Flutter with the ABCD Architecture.
